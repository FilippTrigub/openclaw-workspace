user: Start a task on the remote based on repo imaginary product landing to write a test script. Start one with 1 agent and another task with multiple agents
assistant: ✅ **Both tasks created and running:**

**Single Agent Task:**
- ID: `p6yRdEeLFBCnM2fnGB_75`
- Agent: Blackbox Pro
- Status: **Pending** → Processing
- URL: https://cloud.blackbox.ai/tasks/p6yRdEeLFBCnM2fnGB_75

**Multi-Agent Task (3 agents in parallel):**
- ID: `ex2c5sFdg96_aWo4OqXOd`
- Agents: Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Codex GPT-5.2 + Blackbox Pro
- Status: **Pending** → Processing
- URL: https://cloud.blackbox.ai/tasks/ex2c5sFdg96_aWo4OqXOd

Both are starting now. The multi-agent task will run all three in parallel and compare implementations. Want me to stream logs or check status in a bit?
user: Now stop withe rone
assistant: Let me wait for that to complete:
assistant: Let me kill it and try again:
assistant: The multi-agent task (`ex2c5sFdg96_aWo4OqXOd`) is still pending — it hasn't started processing yet, so it can't be canceled. It'll start soon and then you can stop it.

Want me to:
- Check status and kill it once it's running?
- Leave it and just monitor the single-agent task?
user: [Queued messages while agent was busy]
